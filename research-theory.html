                  <h5>General scope</h5>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    We develop formal and computational theories of the syntax and semantics of various constructions in sign languages, 
                    including various clause types (especially interrogatives and imperatives), polarity marking, number marking on nouns, 
                    and clause embedding. Besides manual signs we also pay particular attention to non-manual features such as facial expressions, 
                    which play a crucial role in many of these constructions, and features characteristic of the signed modality, 
                    such as use of space and iconicity. Our theories are often informed by data from several sign languages, and also 
                    aim to elucidate commonalities and differences between signed and spoken languages. 
                  </p>

                  <h5 class="mb-4">Some specific focus areas</h5>

                  <h6><b>Questions</b></h6>
                  <p>
                    One of our current focus areas concerns the way in which questions are expressed in sign languages.
                    It is known that signers often convey that they are asking a question by means of non-manual markers,
                    for instance by raising their eyebrows. But little is known to date about the full range of non-manual
                    markers that are used to express questions, and how exactly they differ in terms of discourse function.
                    For instance, some non-manual markers might be used to express a neutral question (e.g., Have you met Susan before?)
                    while others might be used to express biased questions (e.g., Haven't you met Susan before?).
                    We are investigating how different kinds of questions are expressed across sign languages.
                  </p>

                  <h6><b>Grammaticalization</b></h6>
                  <p>
                    Grammaticalization is a process of language change, whereby lexical elements take on a grammatical function – think, for instance, of the English verb ‘to go’, which turned into a future tense marker (‘She is going to succeed’). Our research indicates that comparable phenomena exist in sign languages, and that many of the attested changes are actually modality-independent. In addition, however, sign languages have the unique potential to also grammaticalize manual and non-manual co-speech gestures, such as pointing and headshakes.
                  </p>


                  <h6><b>Agreement</b></h6>
                  <p>
                    There is a heated debate in the literature on whether the spatial modulation of certain verbs can be described in terms of agreement. Clearly the use of space comes with modality-specific properties (e.g., the marker of a third-person subject on the verb is not stable, unlike English, where third person is always marked by the suffix -s: ‘She shout-s’). We have taken a position in this debate by arguing that (at least in German Sign Language) the spatial modulation can be accounted for in modality-independent ways, and should thus be classified as an instance of agreement.
                  </p>

                  <h6><b>Reduplication</b></h6>
                  <p>
                    Reduplication is a morphological process whereby a word or part of a word is repeated to mark a change in meaning. Across spoken languages, reduplication is commonly used to realize plurals or certain aspectual meaning (e.g., habituality) – and the same has been found to hold in many unrelated sign languages. Reduplication is interesting, as it is often iconic in both spoken and signed languages, in that the repetition signals a multitude of objects (plural) or a multitude of events (aspect). We are interested in the similarities and differences of various reduplication processes across the two modalities.
