  abstract = {This dissertation addresses the acquisition of Sign Language of the Netherlands (Nederlandse Gebarentaal, NGT) in adult learners with a spoken language background. These learners acquire a new language in a new modality, the visual-spatial modality, which differs from the oral-auditory modality of their native language, Dutch. One of the modality-specific linguistic features attested in signed languages, but not in spoken languages, is the use of space to express grammatical and topographical relations. Our knowledge of the acquisition of linguistic devices related to the use of space (e.g., pointing signs, agreement verbs, classifier predicates and signs marked for location), and of appropriate pedagogical practices to teach these structures, is very limited. This thesis contributes to filling this gap by improving our understanding of processes underlying the acquisition of these devices in L2-learners of NGT, and by investigating whether certain pedagogical practices, which have been shown to be effective for L2-learners of a spoken language, would facilitate the acquisition of these devices. Four studies were carried out. The first three studies, in which we analyze (semi-)natural and elicited production data of novel NGT learners who were followed longitudinally, serve as basis for the fourth study, in which we investigate whether learners benefit from pedagogical interventions aimed at focusing their attention on the form-meaning mappings of one of the devices under investigation, agreement verb forms. This dissertation provides valuable information for practitioners in the field, and adds to our understanding of the intersecting fields of sign language linguistics, second language acquisition and pedagogy, as well as gesture studies.}

  abstract ={This article reports the results of the first longitudinal study that systematically investigates the acquisition of verb agreement by hearing learners of a sign language. During a 2-year period, 14 novel learners of Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT) with a spoken language background performed an elicitation task 15 times. Seven deaf native signers and NGT teachers performed the same task to serve as a benchmark group. The results obtained show that for some learners, the verb agreement system of NGT was difficult to master, despite numerous examples in the input. As compared to the benchmark group, learners tended to omit agreement markers on verbs that could be modified, did not always correctly use established locations associated with discourse referents, and made characteristic errors with respect to properties that are important in the expression of agreement (movement and orientation). The outcomes of the study are of value to practitioners in the field, as they are informative with regard to the nature of the learning process during the first stages of learning a sign language.},

  abstract={This study focuses on nominal pluralization in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). The aim is to offer a comprehensive description of nominal pluralization processes in the language, based on both corpus data and elicited data, taking into account potential phonological restrictions. The results reveal that NGT nouns can undergo several pluralization processes, the main ones being simple reduplication (i.e., repeating the noun sign at one location) and sideward reduplication (i.e., repeating the noun sign while moving the hand sideward). The choice of pluralization process depends on phonological properties of the base noun: (i) nouns that are body-anchored or involve a complex movement undergo simple reduplication; (ii) nouns articulated at the lateral side of the signing space undergo sideward reduplication; (iii) nouns articulated on the midsagittal plane can undergo both simple and sideward reduplication. Strikingly, the data show considerable variation, and all types of nouns can be zero-marked, that is, plural marking on the noun is not obligatory. The results further suggest that all nouns can undergo at least one type of reduplication. Thus, while phonological properties of the base noun influence the type of reduplication, they do not block reduplication altogether. Plural reduplication in NGT is therefore less constrained than has been reported for other sign languages, where certain noun types cannot undergo reduplication. This shows that reduplication – despite being iconically motivated – is subject to language-specific grammatical constraints.},

  year={2020},
  abstract={The present study introduces a novel gap-filling test to elicit plural nouns in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). As of yet, nominal plurals in NGT have not been described in detail, as eliciting plural nouns is not without challenges. In previous research on NGT (Zwitserlood and Nijhof 1999), native signers were asked to describe pictures of plural objects. However, when describing pictures, the signers automatically also expressed the spatial distribution of the objects depicted on the stimulus picture, using localization. As a consequence, it remains unclear what ‘pure’ plurals – without localization – look like. The goal of our gap-filling task is to disentangle pluralization from localization: participants are asked to insert plural nouns in signed sentence contexts where the spatial distribution of the referents is irrelevant. After piloting the task, five deaf native signers participated. The task succeeded in eliciting pure plural forms that were not spatially distributed, and the results show that NGT optionally employs reduplication to mark the pure plural of nouns. We conclude that our gap-filling task successfully controls for localization, targeting the desired structure without using written language. In future studies, the gap-filling task can be applied to other sign languages, targeting also other construction types.},

As for non-manual markers, even more variation is attested; left-to-right head and body movements and narrowed eyes are the most frequently occurring non-manuals in habitual contexts but are by no means obligatory. The findings contrast with the results reported in two previous studies on habituals in NGT (Hoiting & Slobin 2001; Oomen 2016), which can be partially explained by the fact that these studies used elicitation methods. As such, the present study underscores the importance of using a combination of different methods in investigating linguistic phenomena.},

  abstract={We analyze classifier predicates in Russian Sign Language (RSL) using a combination of naturalistic corpus and elicited data in order to determine their argument structure, and to test the generalization, based on research on other sign languages, that there is a clear relation between argument structure and classifier type (Benedicto and Brentari 2004). We propose that whole-entity classifier predicates are intransitive unaccusative, and that body-part classifier predicates are optionally transitive. Contrary to previous research on other sign languages, we argue that handling classifier predicates in RSL describe complex events with two subevents: one of handling, and one of movement, which are not necessarily causally connected. We further suggest that the ‘moving legs’ classifier predicate in RSL also describes a complex event consisting of two subevents. To account for these facts, we develop a formal analysis of classifier predicates in RSL. Specifically, we argue that whole-entity and body-part classifier handshapes are agreement markers, while handling classifier handshapes as well as the ‘moving legs’ classifier handshape represent an argument in combination with a verbal root. This casts doubt on the observation made in the literature that classifiers straightforwardly determine the argument structure of classifier predicates, since different classifiers in RSL represent different grammatical phenomena. In addition, we show that event structures associated with some classifier predicates are more complex than those associated with monoclausal structures in spoken languages.}

Kimmelman argued that in RSL and NGT, doubling is also used for information structure-related functions, but proposed that the functions of doubling are better described as foregrounding. Information structure is a field of linguistics covered in numerous books and articles. Information structure in sign languages has also been investigated almost from the first days of sign linguistics; however, as is often the case, most of the available studies focus on a very small number of sign languages, and among these, American Sign Language is the one most prominently represented. The chapter aims to theoretical research, It discusses the few available experimental or psycholinguistic studies on information structure in sign languages.},

The grammatical description is complemented by a brief overview of the socio-historical background of NGT and of the Dutch sign language community. The European SIGN-HUB project, of which this dissertation is a result, hosts a platform where a digital version of this grammar can be found, along with video fragments providing illustrations of many of the linguistic characteristics addressed in the book: www.sign-hub.eu/grammar.

  abstract={The literature has been divided over the question of whether spatial verbs should be subsumed into a single verb class with agreement verbs. The main point of contention has been that, even if the nature of the elements that these verb types agree with differs, the morphosyntactic mechanism, i.e. a path movement, appears to be the same. Contributing to this debate, this corpus-based study scrutinizes the morphosyntactic properties of a set of spatial verbs in German Sign Language (DGS). It is shown that spatial verbs display striking variability in where they begin and end their movement in space. They may align with locations or person loci, but often they simply mark arbitrary locations, which may convey meaningful yet less specific information about the (direction of) movement of a referent relative to the signer. Furthermore, null subjects are found to occur remarkably often in constructions with spatial verbs, despite the absence of systematic subject marking on the verb itself. These results stand in contrast with those reported for regular agreement verbs in DGS (OOMEN, 2020), and thus provide support for a distinction between the two types. It is proposed that spatial verbs in DGS involve a demonstration component (cf. DAVIDSON, 2015) which ensures the recoverability of referents involved in the event denoted by the verb, thus loosening the restrictions on both agreement marking and subject drop that apply to regular agreement verbs. As such, spatial verbs are argued to be somewhere in between conventionalized lexical verbs and classifier predicates.}

  year={2021},
  abstract={In many sign languages around the world, some verbs can express grammatical agreement with not just one but two arguments, while other verbs do not express agreement at all. Moreover, and rather curiously, there is a remarkable degree of semantic overlap across sign languages between verbs that possess agreement properties. It has been suggested that iconicity has some part to play in this: in sign languages, there is the potential for aspects of verb meaning to be iconically represented in a verb’s form. In this dissertation, I investigate how semantics and morphosyntactic structure interact in constructions containing verbs with varying agreement properties in German Sign Language (DGS), using naturalistic dialogues between signers from the DGS Corpus as the primary data source. I show that certain semantic properties – also known to govern transitivity marking in spoken languages – are predictive of verb type in DGS, where indeed systema- tic iconic mappings play a mediating role. The results enable the formulation of cross-linguistic predictions about the interplay between verb semantics and verb type in sign languages. A subsequent analysis of a range of morphosyntactic properties of different verb types leads up to the conclusion that even ‘plain’ verbs, in fact, grammatically agree with their arguments. This in turn motivates a unified syntactic analysis in terms of agreement of constructions with verbs that do and do not overtly express it, thus presenting a novel solution to the typological puzzle that supposedly only verbs of a (partially) semantically definable subset agree in DGS and other sign languages.},

Issues addressed include (i) historical events and how they were experienced by Deaf people, (ii) issues of identity and independence, (iii) aspects of language change, (iv) experiences of suppression and discrimination. The stories shared by elderly signers reveal intriguing, yet hidden, aspects of Deaf life. On the negative side, these include experiences of the Deaf in Nazi Germany and occupied countries and harsh practices in educational settings, to name a few. On the positive side, there are stories of resilience and vivid memories of school years and social and professional life.

  abstract={Deaf people oftentimes have no choice but to communicate in the lingua franca of their country, despite the fact that this is a second language for them. Their ability to read and write is significantly worse than that of a hearing person. Additionally, if a deaf child is born into a family of hearing parents, it is vital that the parents communicate with the child through sign language as soon as possible, otherwise the language region of that child's brain will be underdeveloped. There are currently few resources available for people to learn Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). A tool that makes this possible would be invaluable to those who need it. <br> This thesis investigates what components are necessary to build a system that uses an avatar to translate a Dutch sentence to NGT. On the basis of the workings of NGT and previous research on the matter, three main components are devised and implemented: software for sign language synthesis, lexical resources for encoding signs, and grammatical resources for structuring sentences. Results show a proof of concept with a corpus of 2226 signs, the ability to make correct use of classifiers, and the abilities to fingerspell any word that is not in the corpus and convey numbers correctly. However, the corpus contains a number of errors and of which manual errors and unnatural mouth signs should particularly be improved. Moreover, further research is necessary to improve the comprehensibility of signs.},
