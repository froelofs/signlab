  abstract = {This dissertation addresses the acquisition of Sign Language of the Netherlands (Nederlandse Gebarentaal, NGT) in adult learners with a spoken language background. These learners acquire a new language in a new modality, the visual-spatial modality, which differs from the oral-auditory modality of their native language, Dutch. One of the modality-specific linguistic features attested in signed languages, but not in spoken languages, is the use of space to express grammatical and topographical relations. Our knowledge of the acquisition of linguistic devices related to the use of space (e.g., pointing signs, agreement verbs, classifier predicates and signs marked for location), and of appropriate pedagogical practices to teach these structures, is very limited. This thesis contributes to filling this gap by improving our understanding of processes underlying the acquisition of these devices in L2-learners of NGT, and by investigating whether certain pedagogical practices, which have been shown to be effective for L2-learners of a spoken language, would facilitate the acquisition of these devices. Four studies were carried out. The first three studies, in which we analyze (semi-)natural and elicited production data of novel NGT learners who were followed longitudinally, serve as basis for the fourth study, in which we investigate whether learners benefit from pedagogical interventions aimed at focusing their attention on the form-meaning mappings of one of the devices under investigation, agreement verb forms. This dissertation provides valuable information for practitioners in the field, and adds to our understanding of the intersecting fields of sign language linguistics, second language acquisition and pedagogy, as well as gesture studies.}

  abstract ={This article reports the results of the first longitudinal study that systematically investigates the acquisition of verb agreement by hearing learners of a sign language. During a 2-year period, 14 novel learners of Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT) with a spoken language background performed an elicitation task 15 times. Seven deaf native signers and NGT teachers performed the same task to serve as a benchmark group. The results obtained show that for some learners, the verb agreement system of NGT was difficult to master, despite numerous examples in the input. As compared to the benchmark group, learners tended to omit agreement markers on verbs that could be modified, did not always correctly use established locations associated with discourse referents, and made characteristic errors with respect to properties that are important in the expression of agreement (movement and orientation). The outcomes of the study are of value to practitioners in the field, as they are informative with regard to the nature of the learning process during the first stages of learning a sign language.},

  abstract={This study focuses on nominal pluralization in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). The aim is to offer a comprehensive description of nominal pluralization processes in the language, based on both corpus data and elicited data, taking into account potential phonological restrictions. The results reveal that NGT nouns can undergo several pluralization processes, the main ones being simple reduplication (i.e., repeating the noun sign at one location) and sideward reduplication (i.e., repeating the noun sign while moving the hand sideward). The choice of pluralization process depends on phonological properties of the base noun: (i) nouns that are body-anchored or involve a complex movement undergo simple reduplication; (ii) nouns articulated at the lateral side of the signing space undergo sideward reduplication; (iii) nouns articulated on the midsagittal plane can undergo both simple and sideward reduplication. Strikingly, the data show considerable variation, and all types of nouns can be zero-marked, that is, plural marking on the noun is not obligatory. The results further suggest that all nouns can undergo at least one type of reduplication. Thus, while phonological properties of the base noun influence the type of reduplication, they do not block reduplication altogether. Plural reduplication in NGT is therefore less constrained than has been reported for other sign languages, where certain noun types cannot undergo reduplication. This shows that reduplication – despite being iconically motivated – is subject to language-specific grammatical constraints.},

  year={2020},
  abstract={The present study introduces a novel gap-filling test to elicit plural nouns in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). As of yet, nominal plurals in NGT have not been described in detail, as eliciting plural nouns is not without challenges. In previous research on NGT (Zwitserlood and Nijhof 1999), native signers were asked to describe pictures of plural objects. However, when describing pictures, the signers automatically also expressed the spatial distribution of the objects depicted on the stimulus picture, using localization. As a consequence, it remains unclear what ‘pure’ plurals – without localization – look like. The goal of our gap-filling task is to disentangle pluralization from localization: participants are asked to insert plural nouns in signed sentence contexts where the spatial distribution of the referents is irrelevant. After piloting the task, five deaf native signers participated. The task succeeded in eliciting pure plural forms that were not spatially distributed, and the results show that NGT optionally employs reduplication to mark the pure plural of nouns. We conclude that our gap-filling task successfully controls for localization, targeting the desired structure without using written language. In future studies, the gap-filling task can be applied to other sign languages, targeting also other construction types.},

We show that both reduplication of the predicate and adverbials with a habitual flavor are used in habitual contexts, but both of these manual markers appear to be optional. As for non-manual markers, even more variation is attested; left-to-right head and body movements and narrowed eyes are the most frequently occurring non-manuals in habitual contexts but are by no means obligatory. The findings contrast with the results reported in two previous studies on habituals in NGT (Hoiting & Slobin 2001; Oomen 2016), which can be partially explained by the fact that these studies used elicitation methods. As such, the present study underscores the importance of using a combination of different methods in investigating linguistic phenomena.},

  abstract={We analyze classifier predicates in Russian Sign Language (RSL) using a combination of naturalistic corpus and elicited data in order to determine their argument structure, and to test the generalization, based on research on other sign languages, that there is a clear relation between argument structure and classifier type (Benedicto and Brentari 2004). We propose that whole-entity classifier predicates are intransitive unaccusative, and that body-part classifier predicates are optionally transitive. Contrary to previous research on other sign languages, we argue that handling classifier predicates in RSL describe complex events with two subevents: one of handling, and one of movement, which are not necessarily causally connected. We further suggest that the ‘moving legs’ classifier predicate in RSL also describes a complex event consisting of two subevents. To account for these facts, we develop a formal analysis of classifier predicates in RSL. Specifically, we argue that whole-entity and body-part classifier handshapes are agreement markers, while handling classifier handshapes as well as the ‘moving legs’ classifier handshape represent an argument in combination with a verbal root. This casts doubt on the observation made in the literature that classifiers straightforwardly determine the argument structure of classifier predicates, since different classifiers in RSL represent different grammatical phenomena. In addition, we show that event structures associated with some classifier predicates are more complex than those associated with monoclausal structures in spoken languages.}

An important component of our discussion is the impact of the visual-gestural modality on the syntactic and prosodic encoding of information structure. Kimmelman argued that in RSL and NGT, doubling is also used for information structure-related functions, but proposed that the functions of doubling are better described as foregrounding. Information structure is a field of linguistics covered in numerous books and articles. Information structure in sign languages has also been investigated almost from the first days of sign linguistics; however, as is often the case, most of the available studies focus on a very small number of sign languages, and among these, American Sign Language is the one most prominently represented. The chapter aims to theoretical research, It discusses the few available experimental or psycholinguistic studies on information structure in sign languages.},

The grammatical description is complemented by a brief overview of the socio-historical background of NGT and of the Dutch sign language community. The European SIGN-HUB project, of which this dissertation is a result, hosts a platform where a digital version of this grammar can be found, along with video fragments providing illustrations of many of the linguistic characteristics addressed in the book: www.sign-hub.eu/grammar. This resource may be used for cross-linguistic research, for the development of NGT acquisition materials, and as a reference work.},

  abstract={The literature has been divided over the question of whether spatial verbs should be subsumed into a single verb class with agreement verbs. The main point of contention has been that, even if the nature of the elements that these verb types agree with differs, the morphosyntactic mechanism, i.e. a path movement, appears to be the same. Contributing to this debate, this corpus-based study scrutinizes the morphosyntactic properties of a set of spatial verbs in German Sign Language (DGS). It is shown that spatial verbs display striking variability in where they begin and end their movement in space. They may align with locations or person loci, but often they simply mark arbitrary locations, which may convey meaningful yet less specific information about the (direction of) movement of a referent relative to the signer. Furthermore, null subjects are found to occur remarkably often in constructions with spatial verbs, despite the absence of systematic subject marking on the verb itself. These results stand in contrast with those reported for regular agreement verbs in DGS (OOMEN, 2020), and thus provide support for a distinction between the two types. It is proposed that spatial verbs in DGS involve a demonstration component (cf. DAVIDSON, 2015) which ensures the recoverability of referents involved in the event denoted by the verb, thus loosening the restrictions on both agreement marking and subject drop that apply to regular agreement verbs. As such, spatial verbs are argued to be somewhere in between conventionalized lexical verbs and classifier predicates.}

  year={2021},
  abstract={In many sign languages around the world, some verbs can express grammatical agreement with not just one but two arguments, while other verbs do not express agreement at all. Moreover, and rather curiously, there is a remarkable degree of semantic overlap across sign languages between verbs that possess agreement properties. It has been suggested that iconicity has some part to play in this: in sign languages, there is the potential for aspects of verb meaning to be iconically represented in a verb’s form. In this dissertation, I investigate how semantics and morphosyntactic structure interact in constructions containing verbs with varying agreement properties in German Sign Language (DGS), using naturalistic dialogues between signers from the DGS Corpus as the primary data source. I show that certain semantic properties – also known to govern transitivity marking in spoken languages – are predictive of verb type in DGS, where indeed systematic iconic mappings play a mediating role. The results enable the formulation of cross-linguistic predictions about the interplay between verb semantics and verb type in sign languages. A subsequent analysis of a range of morphosyntactic properties of different verb types leads up to the conclusion that even ‘plain’ verbs, in fact, grammatically agree with their arguments. This in turn motivates a unified syntactic analysis in terms of agreement of constructions with verbs that do and do not overtly express it, thus presenting a novel solution to the typological puzzle that supposedly only verbs of a (partially) semantically definable subset agree in DGS and other sign languages.},

Issues addressed include (i) historical events and how they were experienced by Deaf people, (ii) issues of identity and independence, (iii) aspects of language change, (iv) experiences of suppression and discrimination. The stories shared by elderly signers reveal intriguing, yet hidden, aspects of Deaf life. On the negative side, these include experiences of the Deaf in Nazi Germany and occupied countries and harsh practices in educational settings, to name a few. On the positive side, there are stories of resilience and vivid memories of school years and social and professional life. In this way, the volume contributes in a significant way to the preservation of the cultural and linguistic heritage of Deaf communities and sheds light on lesser known aspects against an otherwise familiar background.},

  abstract={This paper explores the implementation of a translator to sign language, using the JASigning avatarsoftware. Specifically, translation of Dutch into Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). As Dutch has been translated to a textual version of NGT in previous research, this research translated from textual NGT to synthesised NGT, the output signed by an avatar. This is one of three papers, each focusing on a different aspect of the translator: Lexical Resources, the Signing Space, and Multidimensionality. This paper pertains to the latter, and thus attempts to implement multiple dimensions into the avatar: the manual and non-manual component, which are both necessary to properly articulate a sign. The non-manual component of a sign being, for example, a facial expression, a head shake, the posture ofthe signer, etc. Specifically, it attempts to implement the non-manual markers paired with interrogative and negative constructs in NGT. Although the scope of this project is limited, it could provide a decent foundation for further research.},

  abstract={Hearing parents who have deaf children are often put in a difficult position. They most likely know no sign language and resources for learning are limited and expensive. Research into sign language translation and synthesis has increased in the past two decades, due to a growing interest into making public spaces and services more accessible to Deaf people.<br> This research looks at the potential of a translator from Dutch to Dutch sign language (NGT) using a sign language avatar. In particular the focus lies on the synthesis of directional verbs, a critical grammatical component of sign language. The implementation is very limited and therefore the sentences it produces are not always comprehensible and the signs do not always look natural. It does, however, also demonstrate the potential of a sign language avatar as a tool for learning sign language.},

  abstract={Deaf people oftentimes have no choice but to communicate in the lingua franca of their country, despite the fact that this is a second language for them. Their ability to read and write is significantly worse than that of a hearing person. Additionally, if a deaf child is born into a family of hearing parents, it is vital that the parents communicate with the child through sign language as soon as possible, otherwise the language region of that child's brain will be underdeveloped. There are currently few resources available for people to learn Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). A tool that makes this possible would be invaluable to those who need it. <br> This thesis investigates what components are necessary to build a system that uses an avatar to translate a Dutch sentence to NGT. On the basis of the workings of NGT and previous research on the matter, three main components are devised and implemented: software for sign language synthesis, lexical resources for encoding signs, and grammatical resources for structuring sentences. Results show a proof of concept with a corpus of 2226 signs, the ability to make correct use of classifiers, and the abilities to fingerspell any word that is not in the corpus and convey numbers correctly. However, the corpus contains a number of errors and of which manual errors and unnatural mouth signs should particularly be improved. Moreover, further research is necessary to improve the comprehensibility of signs.},

  abstract={Public transport organisations, such as Dutch railway operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), generally communicate important messages through spoken announcements in the train or station. As a result, Deaf people miss crucial information. Because of varying levels of reading proficiency, textual information is not always a solution. Moreover, video footage is not scalable and will not yield satisfactory results when individual video parts need an update. Virtual sign language avatars can provide consistent, anonymous and scalable translations. For the development of a comprehensible and fluent sign language avatar, collaboration between experts in language technology, avatar technology and sign language is fundamental. Unfortunately, inclusive approaches are not evident in existing technologies. To address these problems, we present a case study on co-designing a sign language avatar for the automatic translation of railway announcements into Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). For the initial design, video sign language translations of NS announcements created by the Dutch Sign Center were annotated and used for the translation basis. A scripted keyframe animation technique for the JASigning avatar engine makes it possible to efficiently create many variants of a given template, without expensive equipment. Three iterative co-design sessions took place with an interdisciplinary research team including deaf sign language experts. Simultaneously, hearing passengers from NS were consulted for additional remarks on the sign language avatar. Subsequently, multiple phrase variants of the system were evaluated within a diverse focus group audience to account for demographic differences. Combining the various disciplines led to mayor adjustments of the avatar (manual movements, facial expressions, mouthing, grammar, transitions between signs, camera angle and speed). With this case study, we aimed to effectively and inclusively develop sign language avatar technology. More research and focus groups are necessary to ensure high quality translations (improved mouthings, facial expressions and prosody), resulting in enhanced comprehensibility and natural appearance of the avatar.}

This causes a language barrier to exist between deaf and hearing people. While tools like Google Translate support many languages, not a single sign language is included. This research reduces the language barrier between deaf and hearing people by developing a synthesis tool for sign language. This research focuses on evaluating different gaming and Virtual Reality avatar animation software to create signing avatars used for the synthesis tool. It also looks at converting motion capture data in to animations for the signing avatars. This conversion is implemented fully for one avatar. The resulting animation shows some unnatural movement but looks promising.},

  abstract={It is of great importance to make Dutch Sign Language (NGT) accessible to hearing people in order to improve the relationship between the deaf and hearing communities. We want to achieve this by creating an application that converts Dutch text to NGT performed by an avatar. To achieve this, an avatar must be created that is able to perform the different components of speaking sign language. In this research, the approach will be to let the avatar adapt motions performed by real live NGT speakers using a motion tracker. The results of previous research showed that gestures with specific finger positions, mainly when fingers overlap, were difficult to track. This research solves this problem by recording a NGT speaker from different views, and combining the results using a rigid body transformation. This way, the number of detected outliers are reduced significantly. The addition of cameras provides more insight into depth usage and estimation of the z-axis. It enables to detect bodyparts that are blocked from the main camera, which leads to more accurate tracking of gestures.},

Because deaf people often have a reading and writing delay and not many hearing people speak sign language, a barrier is formed between deaf people who speak sign language and hearing people who do not. To overcome this problem ’signing avatars’ have been researched in the past decade: 3D computer models that can perform sign language. For the Dutch sign language and many other sign languages, the animation techniques that are used for this are deprecated. This research is focused on using modern techniques for animating these signing avatars. A model was built that shows potential in using these modern techniques to perform signs that are described in a dedicated markup language.},

  abstract={Loss of hearing at young age has devastating effects on the development of a child. One of these effects is a learning deficit. This learning deficit can be strongly mitigated by introducing sign language as soon as deafness is diagnosed. However, most of deaf children are born to hearing parents who can not speak the Dutch Sign Language (NGT). Language acquisition of NGT is difficult for Dutch speaking people, since NGT has its own grammar and vocabulary. The main purpose of this thesis is to find out if modern avatar simulation techniques can be used to create a virtual sign language avatar to aid the learning process of NGT. Results show that modern software is applicable, but three main components are needed by the software in order to do so. A phonetic representation of the sign, a compatible rig with as many control points as needed by the phonetic representation and animation software to alter the orientation/position of the control points.},

  abstract={Linguistic expressions of locative spatial relations in sign languages are mostly visually motivated representations of space involving mapping of entities and spatial relations between them onto the hands and the signing space. These are also morphologically complex forms. It is debated whether modality-specific aspects of spatial expressions modulate spatial language development differently in signing compared to speaking children. In a picture description task, we compared the use of locative expressions for containment, support, and occlusion relations by deaf children acquiring Turkish Sign Language and hearing children acquiring Turkish (age 3;5–9;11). Unlike previous reports suggesting a boosting effect of iconicity, and/or a hindering effect of morphological complexity of the locative forms in sign languages, our results show similar developmental patterns for signing and speaking children's acquisition of these forms. Our results suggest the primacy of cognitive development guiding the acquisition of locative expressions by speaking and signing children.}

  abstract={To talk about space, spoken languages rely on arbitrary and categorical forms (e.g., left, right). In sign languages, however, the visual–spatial modality allows for iconic encodings (motivated form-meaning mappings) of space in which form and location of the hands bear resemblance to the objects and spatial relations depicted. We assessed whether the iconic encodings in sign languages guide visual attention to spatial relations differently than spatial encodings in spoken languages during message preparation at the sentence level. Using a visual world production eye-tracking paradigm, we compared 20 deaf native signers of Sign-Language-of-the-Netherlands and 20 Dutch speakers’ visual attention to describe left versus right configurations of objects (e.g., “pen is to the left/right of cup”). Participants viewed 4-picture displays in which each picture contained the same 2 objects but in different spatial relations (lateral [left/right], sagittal [front/behind], topological [in/on]) to each other. They described the target picture (left/right) highlighted by an arrow. During message preparation, signers, but not speakers, experienced increasing eye-gaze competition from other spatial configurations. This effect was absent during picture viewing prior to message preparation of relational encoding. Moreover, signers’ visual attention to lateral and/or sagittal relations was predicted by the type of iconicity (i.e., object and space resemblance vs. space resemblance only) in their spatial descriptions. Findings are discussed in relation to how “thinking for speaking” differs from “thinking for signing” and how iconicity can mediate the link between language and human experience and guides signers’ but not speakers’ attention to visual aspects of the world.}

In the current study, we tested whether the production of spatial terms by children themselves predicts memory accuracy and whether and how language modality of these encodings modulates memory accuracy differently. Hearing child speakers of Turkish and deaf child signers of Turkish Sign Language described pictures of objects in various spatial relations to each other and later tested for their memory accuracy of these pictures in a surprise memory task. We found that having described the spatial relation between the objects predicted better memory accuracy. However, the modality of these descriptions in sign, speech, or speech-plus-gesture did not reveal differences in memory accuracy.

Less is known about the development of language soon after language exposure and if late exposure hinders all domains of language in children and adults. We compared late signing adults and children (MAge = 8;5) 2 years after exposure to sign language, to their age-matched native signing peers in expressions of two types of locative relations that are acquired in certain cognitive-developmental order: view-independent (IN-ON-UNDER) and view-dependent (LEFT-RIGHT). Late signing children and adults differed from native signers in their use of linguistic devices for view-dependent relations but not for view-independent relations. These effects were also modulated by the morphological complexity. Hindering effects of late language exposure on the development of language in children and adults are not absolute but are modulated by cognitive and linguistic complexity.}

However, this assumption has not been tested for children acquiring sign language. Due to the affordances of the visual-spatial modality of sign languages for iconic expression, signing children might omit event components less frequently than speaking children. Here we analysed motion event descriptions elicited from deaf children (4–10 years) acquiring Turkish Sign Language (TİD) and their Turkish-speaking peers. While children omitted all types of event components more often than adults, signing children and adults encoded more Path and Manner in TİD than their peers in Turkish. These results provide more evidence for a general universal tendency for children to omit event components as well as a modality bias for sign languages to encode both Manner and Path more frequently than spoken languages.}

Here, we further investigate the extent of this relationship in signing deaf children and adults and ask if late sign language exposure, as well as the frequency and the type of spatial language use that might be affected by late exposure, modulate subsequent memory for spatial relations. To do so, we compared spatial language and memory of 8-year-old late-signing children (after 2 years of exposure to a sign language at the school for the deaf) and late-signing adults to their native-signing counterparts. We elicited picture descriptions of Left-Right relations in Turkish Sign Language (Türk İşaret Dili) and measured the subsequent recognition memory accuracy of the described pictures. Results showed that late-signing adults and children were similar to their native-signing counterparts in how often they encoded the spatial relation. However, late-signing adults but not children differed from their native-signing counterparts in the type of spatial language they used. However, neither late sign language exposure nor the frequency and type of spatial language use modulated spatial memory accuracy. Therefore, even though late language exposure seems to influence the type of spatial language use, this does not predict subsequent memory for spatial relations. We discuss the implications of these findings based on the theories concerning the correspondence between spatial language and cognition as related or rather independent systems.}
